  <strong>
    Understand React Server Components and Server Functions by building a framework with them.
  </strong>
  <p>
    In this workshop we'll be building a framework built on React Server Components and Server Functions from scratch. No build tools. No TypeScript, no Vite, no JSX. Just the Browser, Node.js, and React. This is how you develop a <strong>deep</strong> understanding of something. Let's go!

## Prerequisites

- Deep experience with React and features like Suspense and useDeferredValue
- Some experience with Node.js will be helpful

## Pre-workshop Resources

Here are some resources you can read before taking the workshop to get you up to
speed on some of the tools and concepts we'll be covering:

- [React Suspense Workshop](https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/react-suspense)
- ["Mind The Gap" by Ryan Florence at Big Sky Dev Con 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhE-CepH2g)
- [React for Two Computers - Dan Abramov at React Conf 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcj5LSVcxJc)
- [Introducing Zero-Bundle-Size React Server Components](https://react.dev/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components)
- [React Server Components RFC](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/188)
- ["React from Another Dimension" by Dan Abramov at Remix Conf 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMf_xeGPn6s)

## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2.18 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] v20 or greater
- [npm][npm] v8 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].

## Setup

This is a pretty large project (it's actually many apps in one) so it can take
several minutes to get everything set up the first time. Please have a strong
network connection before running the setup and grab a snack.

> **Warning**: This repo is _very_ large. Make sure you have a good internet
> connection before you start the setup process. The instructions below use
> `--depth` to limit the amount you download, but if you have a slow connection,
> or you pay for bandwidth, you may want to find a place with a better
> connection.

Follow these steps to get this set up:

```sh nonumber
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/epicweb-dev/react-server-components.git
cd react-server-components
npm run setup
```

If you experience errors here, please open [an issue][issue] with as many
details as you can offer.

## Starting the app

Once you have the setup finished, you can start the app with:

```
npm start
```

## The Workshop App

Learn all about the workshop app on the
[Epic Web Getting Started Guide](https://www.epicweb.dev/get-started).
